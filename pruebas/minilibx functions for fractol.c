/* Here are the most common event codes and their matching masks:

Event codes (second argument to mlx_hook):

KeyPress        = 2
KeyRelease      = 3
ButtonPress     = 4
ButtonRelease   = 5
MotionNotify    = 6
EnterNotify     = 7
LeaveNotify     = 8
Expose          = 12
DestroyNotify   = 17
Event masks (third argument to mlx_hook):

NoEventMask           = 0L
KeyPressMask          = (1L<<0)
KeyReleaseMask        = (1L<<1)
ButtonPressMask       = (1L<<2)
ButtonReleaseMask     = (1L<<3)
PointerMotionMask     = (1L<<6)
ExposureMask          = (1L<<15)
StructureNotifyMask   = (1L<<17)
17 with mask 0L means “listen for DestroyNotify (window-close) and
 no extra sub-events.”

You can combine masks (e.g. KeyPressMask | ExposureMask) if you
need multiple event types in one hook.

explain to me what those masks are doing, i dont understand that 
syntac

Event masks in X11 (and thus in MiniLibX) are just bitfields where 
each bit enables delivery of a particular class of event. The syntax

KeyPressMask = (1L << 0)
ButtonPressMask = (1L << 2)
StructureNotifyMask = (1L << 17)
means:

1L << n

Take the number 1 (a long integer), then shift its single “1” bit 
left by n positions.

The result is a value where only bit n is set.

E.g. (1L<<0) is 0b…0001, (1L<<2) is 0b…0100, (1L<<17) is a 1 in 
the 18th bit position.

Why masks?

When you call mlx_hook, you give it a mask so the underlying X11
 connection only sends you the kinds of events you asked for 
 (key presses, mouse clicks, window structure changes, etc.).

If you OR together multiple masks, e.g.

KeyPressMask | ExposureMask
you’ll receive both key‐press events and expose (redraw) events 
in that one hook.

The special case 0L

Passing 0L means “no extra mask bits”—you rely only on the event 
code (like 17 for DestroyNotify) and don’t need to filter sub‐types.

So masks are just bit flags. By shifting a 1 into different bit 
positions, you turn on the exact bits corresponding to the event 
classes you want. 

Main mouse button codes in X11 (used by MiniLibX on Linux):

1 → Left click
2 → Middle click
3 → Right click
4 → Scroll up (wheel up)
5 → Scroll down (wheel down)

/* 
✅ In Julia:
c is a constant, chosen once (e.g. from user input)

You vary z₀ (each pixel is a different z₀)

You ask: “For this fixed c, which starting points z₀ stay bounded?”

✅ In Mandelbrot:
z₀ is always 0

c varies (each pixel is a different c)

You ask: “Which complex numbers c keep the sequence starting at 0 bounded?”

So yes:

In Julia, c = constant

In Mandelbrot, c = pixel (i.e. variable)

/*
main:

mlx_hook(mlx.win_ptr, 2, 1L << 0, on_key_press, &env);

- 2: the X11 event code for KeyPress.
- 1L << 0: the mask that enables listening 
for key press events (KeyPressMask).


mlx_hook(mlx.win_ptr, 17, 0L, on_close, &mlx);

- 17: the X11 event code for DestroyNotify (window close).
- 0L: no mask needed for this event.
